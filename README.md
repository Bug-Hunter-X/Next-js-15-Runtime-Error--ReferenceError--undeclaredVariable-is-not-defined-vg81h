# Next.js 15 Runtime Error: Undeclared Variable

This repository demonstrates a runtime error encountered in Next.js 15 when accessing an undeclared variable within a page component.  The error is particularly noticeable in production mode and may not be readily apparent during development.

## Problem

The `about.js` file attempts to access a variable (`undeclaredVariable`) that hasn't been declared. This leads to a `ReferenceError` in production builds.  While development might show a different error or warning, production deployments often fail silently or display an error to the end-user.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file provides a solution.  Ensure all variables are properly declared and initialized before use.  Implement comprehensive error handling to gracefully handle unexpected scenarios.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` (for development).  The error might not manifest in development.
4. Run `npm run build` and `npm run start` (for production).  The error should now be visible.
